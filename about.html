    <p>Hello, My name is Andrew Muhs. I am currently a nontraditional student at Iowa State University studying Management Information Systems with a minor in Statistics.  I enrolled here after spending four years in the US Air Force.</p>

    <p>When I am not at school or spending time with my wife, I am most likely, still studying. Just not for school.  Most frequently you will find me trying to improve my skills by reading anything I can get my hands on; or just simply putting my hands on the keyboard and writing some code.</p>

    <p>I have recently taken on a few web development projects, soon to be on the projects page, and have begun creating a web dev workshop, all to further enhance my knowledge of the trade.</p>

    <p>Web development is not my only interest. I also enjoy photography, design, and technical writing. On top of this I am a self-proclaimed nerd. I say this because most people do not enjoy using spreadsheets of any kind. I could spend hours in Excel...</p>

    <p>What now???</p>
