    <h4 id="sub-title" class="light">Hello! My name is Andrew Muhs.</h4>
    <br/>
    <p>I am currently a nontraditional student at Iowa State University studying Management Information Systems with a minor in Statistics.  I enrolled here after spending four years in the US Air Force as a Conventional Maintenance Technician, Flight Training Manager, and then as an Activity Security Manager and Supervisor.</p>

    <p>If I am not at school, studying, or with my wife, you will find me trying to improve my skills by reading anything I can get my hands on; or just simply putting my hands on the keyboard and writing some code.</p>

    <p>Most recently I have taken on a few web development projects and have begun creating a web dev workshop, all to further enhance my knowledge of the trade. I am also studying a few languages as well. To supplement my understanding of software development and design, which I started here at ISU with Java, I am beginning to learn C/C++.</p>

    <p>Programming is however, only one of my many interests. I also enjoy photography, design, technical writing, and Microsoft Excel. When it comes to Excel, I am a self-proclaimed nerd. I say this because most people do not enjoy using spreadsheets of any kind; I could spend hours in Excel and have made many spreadsheets over the past couple of years. While I was in the Air Force, I created several to improve a few lacking processes and made a large impact on the position.</p>

    <p>As evidence would suggest, I am a voracious learner, and I would like to put my experience to use. I am currently looking for an internship for Summer 2016 and would enjoy applying everything I have learned here at ISU to work for you. Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me and take a look at my <a href="projects.html">projects</a>.</p>

    <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
