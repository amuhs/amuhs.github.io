    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>A brief, informal, introduction to web development; this workshop was designed to provide an overview of html and css in order to provide a start to becoming a web developer.</p>
    <p>Students begin with a skeleton html file and are instructed in its different parts. Once this is completed students are shown a basic web page and asked to duplicate it. Resources as well as a few nudges in the right direction are also provided.</p>
    <p>Once the challenge is complete, the source code is shown, explained further, and the process starts over again.</p>
    <p>There are a total of three challenges, each more difficult than the last and developed to teach the basic fundamentals of html and css.</p>
