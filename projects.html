      <p>While interviewing for an internship, I was taken on a tour of the facilities and noticed that when anyone needed a vehicle they had to sign out the key. In order to sign the key out however, you have to create an event in an Outlook calendar. This immediately jumped out as something to be improved upon so I went to work. What I came up with is what you see above. With a list of keys to pick from, the user can type their name in at the top and select the key desired. The key is then moved from the list on the left and move to the "out" list with the name and timestamp included. Please feel free to click on the picture to explore the key log.</p>
