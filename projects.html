      <p>A user-friendly pdf, designed to increase productivity within a 186-person flight. 
        This enabled users to find, complete, and receive credit for computer-based training 
        more efficiently. The flight experienced an overall increase of productivity by 33%.

      <p>A Microsoft Excel tracker that enables members of a work center, through a graphic 
        user interface, to add or remove parts as well as run various reports. This tracker helped
         to improve the accountability of $36,000 worth of munitions parts.

      <p>While interviewing for an internship, I was taken on a tour of the facilities and noticed 
        that when anyone needed a vehicle they had to sign out the key. In order to sign the key out 
        however, you have to create an event in an Outlook calendar. This immediately jumped out as 
        something to be improved upon so I went to work. What I came up with is what you see above. 
        With a list of keys to pick from, the user can type their name in at the top and select the key 
        desired. The key is then moved from the list on the left and move to the "out" list with the 
        name and timestamp included. Please feel free to click on the picture to explore the key log.

      <h4 id="sub-title" class="light">TaskBot</h4>
      <a href="img/TaskBot.png">
        <img class="left" src="img/TaskBot.png"/>
      </a>
      <p>
        TaskBot was the second of two Slack bots built for MIS-407 projects. This bot allowed a user 
        to track individual tasks and subtasks as well as tasks and subtasks for any groups a user 
        may be apart of. My team decided on this project as it is common for businesses to track 
        tasks only required for projects; however, on the individual level tasks can be forgotten about 
        or even lost when written with pen and paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        The image to the left is an example of the functionality of TaskBot. When our database was initialized 
        our team was assigned the group name "Oracle". This was the only group within our database at this point. 
        I then went on to create a new group named "Shield". When the groups were displayed, TaskBot's output 
        consisted of only the groups I was assigned to, so just Oracle. I then added myself to the Shield group 
        and told TaskBot to once again display the groups. This time the output consisted of both Oracle and 
        Shield.
      </p>
      <p>
        TaskBot was built primarily using the python 3.5 standard libraries.  We also used the Slack API and  
        the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK). We stored our data with a SQLite 3 database. Unittests were also 
        written for our bot, and our code was managed using git.
