The compulsory "Hello, World" post... It only seems right to title this post like that given the fact I work in tech, primarily with software.

Welcome, to my ~~blog~~ ~~Jekyll trial run~~ notebook. Not sure what this will be exactly, maybe this will turn in to something I use, or maybe it won't, only time will tell.

The main reason I started this, was the lack of updates on my original site, I wanted to see what Jekyll was all about, and because I really wanted something that shows code snippets without me having to create it...

Code snippet examples:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name):
    print(f'Hi, {name}')

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
// prints 'Hello, World!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Yay, code snippets!
