I don't spend a lot of time outside of work, working on software projects. It's not that I don't enjoy it, I would just rather spend the time with my family. For the last few months I have had a lot of extra time, being furloughed 50%, and I have spent a lot of it with my family, and some thinking about the software projects I did in college. I don't mean my homework. I mean the side projects I did to learn about other tech. If you scroll through my GitHub repos you will find an incredible lack of forward movement. Outside of this website, I haven't done much of anything since [December 2018](https://github.com/amuhs/sunflower-sop/commits?author=amuhs&since=2018-12-01&until=2019-01-01) and that was just a little clean up so I could delete my Heroku account. 

I took a look at some of the code in the repos I have on GitHub and all they show is a lack of knowledge. That makes sense given I was in college using those projects to learn. I have also come to realize that any code you write will always look bad to future you, but what I wish I saw was growth. Something to show the things I have learned since I have graduated.

I can't, and won't, guarantee that I will move all of my repos forward and improve on them. Infact, I will likely delete some of them. I will say that I am going to work with some of them. I'll even use them to learn again. A lack of knowledge is not a bad thing. Stagnation, at least for me, is.

I am going to start with my [Key Log repository](https://github.com/amuhs/key_log/tree/master).

As of this moment, you can still see the key log [working as a GitHub page](http://amuhs.github.io/key_log/) from when I made it starting back in 2016. Since I am not sure when that link will break (or if I will remember to remove the link...) here is a gif of the current state.

I have already made some changes, made it a node.js project with express, and submitted them back to the `master` branch. In a short while (or long, who really knows) I will make another post with a gif of the new version.

Here is a sneak peak of the current state:
