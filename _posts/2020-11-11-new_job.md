Back in July [I wrote a post]({% post_url 2020-07-25-key_log %}) saying I was going to be updating some of my repositories on GitHub. Well it's November and I haven't done much. What I didn't mention in the post was my searching for a new job as a software developer. I did end up getting a new job. New career rather. I was a DevOps engineer in the manufacturing industry. Now I am an Associate Developer in higher education. It has been a great change and I love going to work each day.

Learning a new job is taxing on the mind and that is why I haven't been working on personal things. That said, I do _hope_ to do some updating before the year is out. We'll see...
