The compulsory "Hello, World" post... It only seems right to title this post like that given the fact I work in tech, primarily with software.

Welcome, to my website. I say website because I am not sure what this is going to be exactly. It will likely be in blog format, like it is now, but I am not entirely sure of the content. This may be more of a notebook for me to put things I have learned and don't want to loose. Regardless,the main reason I started this, was the lack of updates on my original site, I wanted to see what Jekyll was all about, and because I really wanted something with built in code snippets.

Code snippet examples:

```python
def print_hi(name):
    print(f'Hi, {name}')

print_hi('Tom')
# Hi, Tom
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
// Hello, World!
```

Yay, code snippets!
