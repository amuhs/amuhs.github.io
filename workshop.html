    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>A brief, informal, introduction to web development; this workshop was designed to provide an overview of html and css in order to provide a start to becoming a web developer.</p>
    <p>Students begin with a skeleton html file and are instructed in its different parts. Once this is completed students are shown a basic web page and asked to duplicate it. Resources as well as a few nudges in the right direction are also provided.</p>
    <p>Once the challenge is complete, the source code is shown, explained further, and the process starts over again.</p>
    <p>There are a total of three challenges, each more difficult than the last and developed to teach the basic fundamentals of html and css.</p>

    <br/>
    <h1>What You Need</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Laptop</li>
      <li>Text Editor</li>
      <li>Internet Connection*</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While suing a text editor is not required, it is strongly recommended. Using Notepad, in Windows, or TextEdit, on a Mac, can cause headaches when trying to use file extensions other than ".txt".</p>

    <p>My recommendation is <a href="https://atom.io/"target="_blank">Atom</a> by GitHub. It is easy to use and allows you to see your entire project directory while you are working.</p>

    <p style="font-size: .75em"><em>*An internet connection is not required if you do not link to a website or a file on a web server.</em></p>

    <br/>
    <h1>Setup</h1>
    <p>There are two ways to prepare for your workshop. You can download the <a href="docs/web-workshop.zip" download>web-workshop.zip</a> file, and call it a day. Or you can follow the steps below.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a folder to contain your project. I suggest, "web-workshop".</li>
      <li>Inside of this folder, create a file called, "index.html".</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>This can be down with a simple word processor I suggest using a text editor designed for this task. See "What You Need" above.</li>
        <li>As well as being the homepage for your web project, this will be the main file used in this workshop.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>While still inside the project, or parent, folder, create a folder named, "css".</li>
      <li>Move inside the newly created "css" folder.</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>You should now be two folders deep: ../web-workshop/css</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Create a file called, "main.css".</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Your folder / file structure should look like this:</li>
      </ol>
      <br/>
      <img src="img/folder-struct.png"/>
      <br/>
      <li>Open the file, "index.html"</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>You will need to right-click and use "open with" and select you text editor of choice.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Type the follow into this file:</li>
      <div class="pre">
        <pre>
           &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
           &lt;html&gt;
           &lt;head&gt;
             &lt;title&gt;Web Dev Workshop&lt;/title&gt;
           &lt;/head&gt;
           &lt;body&gt;
             &lt;!-- this is a comment --&gt;

           &lt;/body&gt;
           &lt;/html&gt;
        </pre>
    </div>
    <li>Your done! The html above will be explained during the workshop.</li>
    </ol>
    <br/>
    <h1>Resources</h1>
    <p>When you first start learning to develop web pages, you are going to need help. Even as you progress in your career. You are still not going to remember everything.
